# prospect

## configuration

the configuration file and its structure of prospect is described in the sections that
follow:

### top table

* archive: directory where data files are metadata files (or zip file) will be created
* no-data: tell prospect to only generate the metadata file
* path   : [path pattern](#Path generation) used to build the final path of the file in the archive

### meta

the meta table (and its sub tables) groups all properties that describe the experiment itself. The options are used to generate the MD_EXP_<experiment>.xml file. The only exception is the dtstart, dtend options that can be used in parallel with the schedule option of the command.

* acronym     : name of the experiment
* experiment  : full name of the experiment
* id          : erasmus experiment ID
* dtstart     : start date of the experiment
* dtend       : end date of the experiment
* fields      : list of research fields
* coordinators: list of people invovled in the experiments
* increments  : list of increments (start-end)

#### meta.payload

* name   : full name of the payload
* acronym: acronym of the payload
* class  : class of the payload

### dataset

* rootdir  : not used
* owner    : dataset owner
* level    : processing level of the dataset
* integrity: [hash algorithm](#Supported hash algorithms) to compute the digest of the data files
* model    : source having generating the dataset

### period

* dtstart: start date of a period of activity
* dtend  : end date of a period of activity
* source : activity performed during this period

### module

* module  : path to the plugin/module to be loaded by prospect
* location: path to data files (can be a pattern, a directory, a file - plugin specific)
* type    : product type handles by the plugin
* mime    : file format handles by the plugin
* path    : [path pattern](#Path generation) used to build the final path of the file in the archive
* level   : product level
* config  : plugin specific configuration file
* acqtime : algorithm to be used to compute the acquisition time of a data file

notes:

* the type and mime option even if set, can be ignore by the plugin implementation.
* the level option even if set, can be ignore by the plugin implementation.
* the config option even if set, can be ignore by the plugin implementation.
* the acqtime option even if set, can be ignore by the plugin implementation.

#### module.mimetype

* extension: list of extensions (prefixed with a dot)
* mime     : mime type to be set for the given list of extension
* type     : product type matching the extension and the mime type

## Enumerations

### Model

* Flight Model
* Engineering Model
* Training Model
* None

### Product types

* High Rate Telemetry
* Medium Rate Telemetry
* High Rate Science Data
* High Rate Image Data
* Video Stream
* Command History

* Documentation
* Mission Data Base

### Data source

* Science Run
* Engineering Test

# Supported hash algorithms

prospect can generate the digest for the data files with the following well known
algorithm:

* MD5
* SHA-1
* SHA-256
* SHA-512

# Path generation

in order to control the final location of files in the archive, prospect uses a
parameterizable path pattern via the {} notation. The parameters that can be used
in this pattern will be used to create the final path.

the following properties can be used:

* source
* model
* mime
* format
* type
* year
* doy
* month
* day
* hour
* minute
* second
* timestamp

note that any "propreties" not recognized by prospect will be injected by prospect
as is in the final path.

## Plugins

### basic

basic plugin set the following experiment specific metadata:

* file.size

if no mime types are set in the module config or none match, the plugin set the mimetype
property to: **application/octet-stream**

if no type is set in the module config, the plugin set the type property to: **data**

### rt

rt plugin set the following experiment specific metadata:

* file.duration
* file.numrec
* file.size
* file.corrupted

if no mime types are set in the module config or none match, the plugin set the mimetype
property to: **application/octet-stream;access=sequential,form=unformatted**

if no type is set in the module config, the plugin set the type property to:
**medium rate telemetry**

### hadock

hadock plugin set the following experiment specific metadata:

* file.size
* hrd.channel
* hrd.source
* hrd.upi
* hrd.instance
* hrd.mode
* hrd.fcc
* hrd.pixels.x
* hrd.pixels.y
* hrd.invalid

if no mime types are set in the module config or none match, the plugin set the mimetype
property to: **application/octet-stream**

if no type is set in the module config, the plugin set the type property to:
**high rate data**

### icn - intre-console note

icn plugin set the following experiment specific metadata:

* file.size
* file.numrec
* ptr.%d.href
* ptr.%d.role

if no mime types are set in the module config or none match, the plugin set the mimetype
property to: **text/plain;access=sequential;form=block-formatted;type=icn**

if no type is set in the module config, the plugin set the type property to:
**intre-console note**

### icn - uplinked file

icn plugin set the following experiment specific metadata:

* file.size
* file.md5
* uplink.file.local
* uplink.file.uplink
* uplink.file.mmu
* uplink.time.uplink
* uplink.time.transfer
* uplink.source
* ptr.%d.href
* ptr.%d.role

if no mime types are set in the module config or none match, the plugin set the mimetype
property to: **text/plain**

if no type is set in the module config, the plugin set the type property to:
**uplink file**

the icn plugin expects having as input file (specified in the location option) a csv file
with the following fields (in the given order):

* source ICN
* uplinked file
* original filename
* command filename
* filename used for uplink
* sid
* uplink time
* transfer time
* warning
* file size
* md5

this kind of file can be generated thanks to the script scripts/icn.awk

### csv

the csv plugin set the following experiment specific metadata:

* file.size
* file.duration
* file.numrec
* csv.%d.header

the csv plugin expects that all the rows in the input files contains exactly the same
number of fields.

### mbox

currently the mbox plugin is the only one using its own configuration file.

the mbox plugin set the following experiment specific metadata:

* file.size
* mail.subject
* mail.description
* ptr.%d.href
* ptr.%d.role
